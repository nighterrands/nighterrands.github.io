Sleep is one of the most important components of mental health, and the disorders of sleep often are prelude and epilogue to events of mental illness. Living through prolonged events of sleep disturbance can be akin to living in a lucid dream, or an unending waking nightmare depending on circumstance.  Sleep and sleep mechanics are of great interest to me and having my own experience with the disintegration of sleep taught me an enormous amount about not only myself but the fragility of our mental heath.  It is a time and feeling state I hope to never suffer again but am glad I was able to tolerate and endure. This record is an attempt to recreate the noise in my mind, the fear in my soul, and the eventual peace that came at the end of the journey. I hope it finds you well\u2026\n\nStage one of sleep, also known as the transitional phase, occurs when one finds themselves floating in and out of consciousness. During this NREM stage, you may be partially awake while your mind begins to drift off. This period of drowsiness eventually leads to a light sleep. This is also the time when the muscles jerk, followed by a falling sensation that jolts you back into consciousness. This experience is known as hypnic myoclonia.\n\nStage two is also a non-REM phase and is one of the lighter stages of sleep. Even though it is a light stage, the heart rate begins to slow and the core body temperature decreases. During stage two, eye movement stops and brain waves slow with the occasional burst of waves called sleep spindles. Stage two can also be characterized by the unstructured periods that alternate between muscle tone and muscle relaxation.\n\nStage three is where deep, slow brain waves known as Delta Waves begin to emerge. It is a transitional period between light sleep and a very deep sleep. Your blood pressure will start to drop. Stages three and four are also the stages during which you are most likely to experience sleep walking and night terrors.\n\nStage four sleep is where slow delta brainwaves will occur and your blood pressure will continue to drop. It\u2019s very difficult to rouse someone from deep sleep and, if you do awaken suddenly from this stage, you may feel groggy and disorientated for quite a while. This is the sleep stage where your body will repair itself and it can last for up to an hour; during this stage hormones such as Human Growth Hormone are released and the blood supply to your muscles will increase. This stage of sleep is also extremely important for immune system and general health.\n\n\nCredits:\nRecording and Mixing: <a class="ne-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/leofromvermont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leo From Vermont</a>\nMastering: <a class="ne-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/m_geddes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M.

We push back by becoming active, becoming producers, and putting our little pieces of creativity down next to it. It\u2019s this idea, I can do something, too." - Nathaniel Mackey\n\nAnd so begins my writing career, and the night errands blog.\n\nHere\'s what I\'m thinking for this column currently titled <em>Connections</em>. We\'ll roughly trace a connection between four records, exploring the interesting (according to the author) components of each to varying extents. The malleability of these connections is left entirely to my discretion, however. Mutually unorthodox instrumentation? Sure. Cover art similarities? Yup. Two artists are both big Chicago Bears fans? Definitely. Basically anything my brain is capable of tying together is fair game, so strap in.\n\n{{header "On the Corner"}}\nThis album is fantastic. So thick. Electric Miles is the best Miles (<em>In a Silent Way</em> is unimpeachable). What else is there to say that hasn\'t been said already? Our connection springs from some reading I was doing on the album while sitting on the couch deep in the thick of it. The Wikipedia page talks about how a big influence of Miles\' during this time was Karlheinz Stockhausen. What? Miles would apparently drive his Lamborghini around playing a cassette of <em>Hymnen</em>, a two hour long work which stitches together national anthems of the world in this disturbing scanning-through-radio-stations collage. What??\n\n{{image http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tT_C3bk6fRI/UgNixEz0PmI/AAAAAAAACVA/aazhJwukE4Y/s1600/Miles-Davis-Red-1967-Ferrari-275-GTB4-Driving.jpg ""}}\n\nI say "what" somewhat facetiously above, as this does in fact strike me as pretty standard Miles. I highly recommend his autobiography - it\'s loaded with fantastic stuff like that and on average every third word in the book is "motherfucker", so that\'s captivating to an extent. Anyway, off to Stockhausen.\n\n{{header "Stockhausen"}}\nThis naturally led to me listening to some Stockhausen which I found pretty hit or miss. Some really cool shit in there - his top albums on Spotify contain some pretty good stuff. Incredible outer space music. The most vivid and descriptive percussion ensemble I\'ve ever heard; at times the soundtrack of a petty criminal on the job, at times earth-shaking epics. I picked up this record purely for the Stockhausen name at Red Onion a bit ago. These contemporary classical comp albums are a new genre I\'m starting to take the dive into. CRI seems to be a pretty good label for this stuff, and I\'m growing more and more convinced anything in this era on Deutsche Grammophon is going to be awesome.\n\n{{image https://idagio-images.global.ssl.fastly.net/albums/00028944743029/main.jpg?auto=format&dpr=1&crop=faces&fit=crop&w=720&h=720 "On the topic of Deutsche Grammophon... <em>Jeux d\'eau</em> is perfectly flowing and free."}}\n\nThe Stockhausen track on this record is a doozy. Rough stuff. Not for me. I think it helps to approach this sort of music with the term sonics in mind - trying to focus on all the physics wave mumbo-jumbo components of sound. Doesn\'t always work. The more interesting track on this album for me is the version of <em>Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima</em> which I recognized from the completely bonkers episode of Twin Peaks where David Lynch forces the viewer to experience nuclear fission (as I write this, I think of a secondary connection to our third record which we will explore later). That third season is so wonderful - currently reflecting with joy on our time with <a class="ne-link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/06/twin-peaks-in-praise-of-dougie-jones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dougie Jones</a>.\n\n{{embed "<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/229621231?h=c579f5522a&color=ffffff&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}}\n\nNot all of Stockhausen\'s stuff I\'ve listened to so far has clicked with me, or hasn\'t clicked yet. Stockhausen and his work did, however, become the jumping off point for our next connection by initiating my foray into this so-called New Music and Stockhausen\'s peer, Luigi Nono.\n\n{{header "Nono"}}\nBecause this is generally such aesthetically challenging music, I find any appreciation of Nono\'s music divorced from the context of his life and beliefs to be impossible (and I\'d bet Nono would say the same), so I\'ll try to provide some of the important details. I\'m not going to do this justice, go read his Wikipedia and some liner notes, it\'s truly fascinating, but I\'ll try to set the hook. Centrally, Nono was a member of the colloquial Italian Resistance, a group opposing Italian and German fascist leadership in the mid-twentieth century. Considering what we know of that time period, I\'m sure you can see how composing music while holding these beliefs in that era could lead toward an abandonment of the traditional beauty in music. When joy and beauty have left the world, shouldn\'t our music reflect that?\n\nNono\'s compositions must be contextualized through this political lens. He would often lecture and perform his pieces in trade unions and factories in an effort to captivate the working class. He contributed anti-imperialist articles to political journals. He believed in art that was both reflective of and rooted in the common reality of the masses. You know, this makes me think of the core principles of Peter Schumann\'s Bread and Puppet Theater. Great stuff over there as well, like costumed groundskeepers who force everyone in the audience to give them a little wave. And zebra chases. And singing beans who are rude to one another. And various other circus shenanigans.\n\nAs an example of this political context being made explicit in his work, consider Nono\'s attribution of the decomposed recordings used in <em>A Floresta \xc9 Jovem e Cheja de Vida</em>: "eleven moments of the anti-imperialist struggle, of reflection, of difficulty, of defeat, of lament, of conscience and of determination to continue the harsh and long struggle, of questioning." Heavy stuff! The eponymous text of that composition is pretty powerful; it is a quote from an Angolan guerilla fighter: "they cannot burn the forest for it is young and full of life." And so the struggle continues. Another referenced text for <em>A Floresta...</em> is Herman Kahn\'s escalation ladder, presented in what I have to assume is Nono saying, "just get a good look at the absurdity of all this." I found out while following this thread that Kahn was the inspiration for Kubrick\'s Dr. Strangelove. How\'s that for a tidbit? Hey! Guess what? This is the secondary connection I was thinking of earlier - nuclear fission & escalation ladder. This connection is very strong, Brandon Sanderson would approve (and perhaps even call it a Connection?).\n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/connections1/escalationladder.jpg "Could we stay at 0 please?"}}\n\nHopefully this is enough to leave you inspired to give Nono\'s music a try. I don\'t think there\'s anything insightful for me to say about the composition or substance of his music, but I do know what it evokes for me: this is devastated music, by a devastated human, from a devastated era. If you can summon up the acceptance and empathy to immerse yourself in it, it is immensely captivating and absolutely aching with pain. Truly music for a post-war depression.\n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/connections1/nono.jpg "Devastated... I feel like this is the look I get when a quesadilla flip goes awry"}}\n\nAnd now to prove that this isn\'t all going to be seriousness and that our connections can be as arbitrary as I like, allow me to transition from all of this into a Godzilla movie soundtrack.\n\n{{header "Godzilla"}}\n\nGodzilla fighting Mothra from Italian World War II resistance. Bam. This record has such a fantastic cover. I love to picture some Japanese dude in this elaborate Godzilla costume standing around slapping some other Japanese dude in this elaborate Mothra costume. Wow they must have had a blast filming that. Thanks to some generous translation work from <a class="ne-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/sanonagai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sano</a>, I\'ve learned that this is the third of a ten volume set of soundtracks from sci-fi movies. The three movies for this record are Mothra vs Godzilla, Giant Space Monster Dogora, and Giant Space War. What a trio! Such grandeur. I hope Earth survives all these giant monsters and space conflicts. Regarding the music, I wish it was a little more sci-fi and a little less "theme" Would one synthesizer really have broken the bank here? Those costumes are so high budget, I\'m sure you can afford a Moog. Regardless, still well worth what I gave a dude wearing a flat cap at the Silver Spring record fair to get this one.\n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/connections1/godzillanooo.jpg "The snippet provided is from a track called <em>Godzilla\'s Revenge</em>. I like to think it soundtracks this moment: \'Get up Godzilla! We believe in you!\'"}}\n\nThanks for enduring all that.

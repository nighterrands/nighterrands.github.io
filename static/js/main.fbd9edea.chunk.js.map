Sleep is one of the most important components of mental health, and the disorders of sleep often are prelude and epilogue to events of mental illness. Living through prolonged events of sleep disturbance can be akin to living in a lucid dream, or an unending waking nightmare depending on circumstance.  Sleep and sleep mechanics are of great interest to me and having my own experience with the disintegration of sleep taught me an enormous amount about not only myself but the fragility of our mental heath.  It is a time and feeling state I hope to never suffer again but am glad I was able to tolerate and endure. This record is an attempt to recreate the noise in my mind, the fear in my soul, and the eventual peace that came at the end of the journey. I hope it finds you well…\\n\\nStage one of sleep, also known as the transitional phase, occurs when one finds themselves floating in and out of consciousness. During this NREM stage, you may be partially awake while your mind begins to drift off. This period of drowsiness eventually leads to a light sleep. This is also the time when the muscles jerk, followed by a falling sensation that jolts you back into consciousness. This experience is known as hypnic myoclonia.\\n\\nStage two is also a non-REM phase and is one of the lighter stages of sleep. Even though it is a light stage, the heart rate begins to slow and the core body temperature decreases. During stage two, eye movement stops and brain waves slow with the occasional burst of waves called sleep spindles. Stage two can also be characterized by the unstructured periods that alternate between muscle tone and muscle relaxation.\\n\\nStage three is where deep, slow brain waves known as Delta Waves begin to emerge. It is a transitional period between light sleep and a very deep sleep. Your blood pressure will start to drop. Stages three and four are also the stages during which you are most likely to experience sleep walking and night terrors.\\n\\nStage four sleep is where slow delta brainwaves will occur and your blood pressure will continue to drop. It's very difficult to rouse someone from deep sleep and, if you do awaken suddenly from this stage, you may feel groggy and disorientated for quite a while. This is the sleep stage where your body will repair itself and it can last for up to an hour; during this stage hormones such as Human Growth Hormone are released and the blood supply to your muscles will increase. This stage of sleep is also extremely important for immune system and general health.\\n\\n\\nCredits:\\nRecording and Mixing: <a class=\\\"ne-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/leofromvermont/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Leo From Vermont</a>\\nMastering: <a class=\\\"ne-link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/m_geddes/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">M.

It looks the same, but something changed. Something is, uhh, I'm not sure of the best way to say it. Wrong?  I'm not sure that's exactly right. Something is different, that's probably more like it.\\n\\nYeah, last time we came it was a blast. All the same vintage Hawaiian style decorations, funky drink glasses, and wacky drink specials. Yeah, totally, those little umbrellas and all that shit haha. Our waitress was hilarious. And it was pretty cheap! They played that Santo and Johnny song like 8 times. What's it called? Yeah, sleep walk. That's definitely it.\\n\\nYou see the bartender? Yeah that's him. Let's see if he knows what's up. Hey. Hey! Can I get a drink? Huh. Maybe he can't hear me...\\n\\nWanna bounce? Yeah, let's go up the street. I'm getting creeped out. Plus it's freezing in here.\\n\\nYou smell that? Nah, nothing. Don't worry about it. Yeah, sure. Oh, ok. I'll just catch you later. Totally, see you in a bit...\\\"\\n\\nCryptic messages and mysterious happenings are only some of the vibe in the ‘Abandoned Tiki Bar.'

We live in this act of creation that is unfathomable and overwhelming. The intricacy, beauty, fearsomeness. We push back by becoming active, becoming producers, and putting our little pieces of creativity down next to it. It's this idea, I can do something, too.\" - Nathaniel Mackey\n\nAnd so begins my writing career, and the night errands blog.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking for this column currently titled <em>Connections</em>. We'll roughly trace a connection between four records, exploring the interesting (according to the author) components of each to varying extents. The malleability of these connections is left entirely to my discretion, however. Mutually unorthodox instrumentation? Sure. Cover art similarities? Yup. Two artists are both big Chicago Bears fans? Definitely. Basically anything my brain is capable of tying together is fair game, so strap in.\n\n{{header \"On the Corner\"}}\nThis album is fantastic. So thick. Electric Miles is the best Miles (<em>In a Silent Way</em> is unimpeachable). What else is there to say that hasn't been said already? Our connection springs from some reading I was doing on the album while sitting on the couch deep in the thick of it. The Wikipedia page talks about how a big influence of Miles' during this time was Karlheinz Stockhausen. What? Miles would apparently drive his Lamborghini around playing a cassette of <em>Hymnen</em>, a two hour long work which stitches together national anthems of the world in this disturbing scanning-through-radio-stations collage. What??\n\n{{image http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tT_C3bk6fRI/UgNixEz0PmI/AAAAAAAACVA/aazhJwukE4Y/s1600/Miles-Davis-Red-1967-Ferrari-275-GTB4-Driving.jpg \"\"}}\n\nI say \"what\" somewhat facetiously above, as this does in fact strike me as pretty standard Miles. I highly recommend his autobiography - it's loaded with fantastic stuff like that and on average every third word in the book is \"motherfucker\", so that's captivating to an extent. Anyway, off to Stockhausen.\n\n{{header \"Stockhausen\"}}\nThis naturally led to me listening to some Stockhausen which I found pretty hit or miss. Some really cool shit in there - his top albums on Spotify contain some pretty good stuff. Incredible outer space music. The most vivid and descriptive percussion ensemble I've ever heard; at times the soundtrack of a petty criminal on the job, at times earth-shaking epics. I picked up this record purely for the Stockhausen name at Red Onion a bit ago. These contemporary classical comp albums are a new genre I'm starting to take the dive into. CRI seems to be a pretty good label for this stuff, and I'm growing more and more convinced anything in this era on Deutsche Grammophon is going to be awesome.\n\n{{image https://idagio-images.global.ssl.fastly.net/albums/00028944743029/main.jpg?auto=format&dpr=1&crop=faces&fit=crop&w=720&h=720 \"On the topic of Deutsche Grammophon... <em>Jeux d'eau</em> is perfectly flowing and free.\"}}\n\nThe Stockhausen track on this record is a doozy. Rough stuff. Not for me. I think it helps to approach this sort of music with the term sonics in mind - trying to focus on all the physics wave mumbo-jumbo components of sound. Doesn't always work. The more interesting track on this album for me is the version of <em>Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima</em> which I recognized from the completely bonkers episode of Twin Peaks where David Lynch forces the viewer to experience nuclear fission (as I write this, I think of a secondary connection to our third record which we will explore later). That third season is so wonderful - currently reflecting with joy on our time with <a class=\"ne-link\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/06/twin-peaks-in-praise-of-dougie-jones.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dougie Jones</a>.\n\n{{embed \"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/229621231?h=c579f5522a&color=ffffff&portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\"}}\n\nNot all of Stockhausen's stuff I've listened to so far has clicked with me, or hasn't clicked yet. Stockhausen and his work did, however, become the jumping off point for our next connection by initiating my foray into this so-called New Music and Stockhausen's peer, Luigi Nono.\n\n{{header \"Nono\"}}\nBecause this is generally such aesthetically challenging music, I find any appreciation of Nono's music divorced from the context of his life and beliefs to be impossible (and I'd bet Nono would say the same), so I'll try to provide some of the important details. I'm not going to do this justice, go read his Wikipedia and some liner notes, it's truly fascinating, but I'll try to set the hook. Centrally, Nono was a member of the colloquial Italian Resistance, a group opposing Italian and German fascist leadership in the mid-twentieth century. Considering what we know of that time period, I'm sure you can see how composing music while holding these beliefs in that era could lead toward an abandonment of the traditional beauty in music. When joy and beauty have left the world, shouldn't our music reflect that?\n\nNono's compositions must be contextualized through this political lens. He would often lecture and perform his pieces in trade unions and factories in an effort to captivate the working class. He contributed anti-imperialist articles to political journals. He believed in art that was both reflective of and rooted in the common reality of the masses. You know, this makes me think of the core principles of Peter Schumann's Bread and Puppet Theater. Great stuff over there as well, like costumed groundskeepers who force everyone in the audience to give them a little wave. And zebra chases. And singing beans who are rude to one another. And various other circus shenanigans.\n\nAs an example of this political context being made explicit in his work, consider Nono's attribution of the decomposed recordings used in <em>A Floresta É Jovem e Cheja de Vida</em>: \"eleven moments of the anti-imperialist struggle, of reflection, of difficulty, of defeat, of lament, of conscience and of determination to continue the harsh and long struggle, of questioning.\" Heavy stuff! The eponymous text of that composition is pretty powerful; it is a quote from an Angolan guerilla fighter: \"they cannot burn the forest for it is young and full of life.\" And so the struggle continues. Another referenced text for <em>A Floresta...</em> is Herman Kahn's escalation ladder, presented in what I have to assume is Nono saying, \"just get a good look at the absurdity of all this.\" I found out while following this thread that Kahn was the inspiration for Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. How's that for a tidbit? Hey! Guess what? This is the secondary connection I was thinking of earlier - nuclear fission & escalation ladder. This connection is very strong, Brandon Sanderson would approve (and perhaps even call it a Connection?).\n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/connections1/escalationladder.jpg \"Could we stay at 0 please?\"}}\n\nHopefully this is enough to leave you inspired to give Nono's music a try. I don't think there's anything insightful for me to say about the composition or substance of his music, but I do know what it evokes for me: this is devastated music, by a devastated human, from a devastated era. If you can summon up the acceptance and empathy to immerse yourself in it, it is immensely captivating and absolutely aching with pain. Truly music for a post-war depression.\n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/connections1/nono.jpg \"Devastated... I feel like this is the look I get when a quesadilla flip goes awry\"}}\n\nAnd now to prove that this isn't all going to be seriousness and that our connections can be as arbitrary as I like, allow me to transition from all of this into a Godzilla movie soundtrack.\n\n{{header \"Godzilla\"}}\n\nGodzilla fighting Mothra from Italian World War II resistance. Bam. This record has such a fantastic cover. I love to picture some Japanese dude in this elaborate Godzilla costume standing around slapping some other Japanese dude in this elaborate Mothra costume. Wow they must have had a blast filming that. Thanks to some generous translation work from <a class=\"ne-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sanonagai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sano</a>, I've learned that this is the third of a ten volume set of soundtracks from sci-fi movies. The three movies for this record are Mothra vs Godzilla, Giant Space Monster Dogora, and Giant Space War. What a trio! Such grandeur. I hope Earth survives all these giant monsters and space conflicts. Regarding the music, I wish it was a little more sci-fi and a little less \"theme\". Would one synthesizer really have broken the bank here? Those costumes are so high budget, I'm sure you can afford a Moog. Regardless, still well worth what I gave a dude wearing a flat cap at the Silver Spring record fair to get this one.\n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/connections1/godzillanooo.jpg \"The snippet provided is from a track called <em>Godzilla's Revenge</em>.

Fucking records. They're everywhere around me and I never can stop myself looking for more. Despite all that effort in acquisition I also, ironically, never spend quite enough time with the ones I have. Even the ones I love. Particularly those “I'm gonna need an XXL coffin because I'm taking these with me” type albums (and 45's). I have no interest in psychoanalyzing myself, but I will occasionally drop some notes on a few favorites in the feed here and do a lil campfire sesh.\n\nRound one: Check Out my Privates, vol 1 (aka digging stories about weird/cool records that are private/vanity pressings). \n\n{{header \"Raymond Moody\"}}\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/corrections1/image1.jpeg \"(Insert Photo 2)\"}}\n<em>Slum Flower</em> is the kind of record that I think about when I'm thinking about going to look for records. This was dug out of a classical bin in Burlington, Vermont many many years ago, at the old Recycle North on Pine street (RIP). Remember kids, never neglect the classical section, particularly in thrift stores. People file wild shit in there sometimes. This is one of those cases:\n\nThis record is poetry read by Raymond Moody, pressed to record after his untimely death. According to the back he became a drug addict at 17 and died on 20 December, 1968. He was from Newark, New Jersey, and must have recorded these poems onto a cassette recorder based on sound quality. The pain in his voice, the anguish, is so stark, and it's made even more immediate by the fact that you can hear traffic in the background as he reads. It's haunting but intimate, and absolutely kills me. \n\nHis aunt Sadie wrote the liner notes and says, “Raymond was not a bad boy - he loved and wanted to be loved and liked by everyone. He was god's child but he lived in a bad neighborhood, the ghetto, and got involved with the wrong crowd.” It's a sad story about a sad reality, and unfortunately not a rare one. Songs like <em>Only if you would let me</em> and <em>Let me die, let me die</em> speak to the desperation. Raymond‘s ability to put these thoughts and feelings into poetry, however, is what makes this recording so special. \n\nHis aunt concludes the liner notes by saying: “Raymond begged for help but it always came too late. So this is his first and last album.” And the world is the worse off for only having this one, and better for its existence. \n\n{{header \"Prince (Skip) Farian\"}}\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/corrections1/image2.jpeg \"(Insert Photo 3)\"}}\nI recently recounted the story of finding this record on Instagram, but I'll bore you with it here as well. I was in Jacksonville, the jewel of northern Florida, for a bachelor party some 15 or 20 years ago. My friend Joe, or “Navy Joe” as we used to call him, was getting hitched. It was an interesting group, pulled from many different, shall we say, “walks of life,” and as such was a shit show. But I mean that in the best possible way. The night ended in a Waffle House that had a liquor store in the back, and once you have those two details I probably don't need to finish this sentence.\n\nI woke up next morning in a double bed in a hotel room with two giant good ol' boys snoring and sweating cheap bourbon all over me. I'll never look at bottle of Old Crow the same again. And I had one of those hangovers that only Bill Burroughs could effectively convey. Let me tell you though, it was FOR REAL. I knew there was only one thing I could do to make the pain stop, and that was go out in the sticky north Florida heat and look for some records. My bff Adam was down for the ride, so we left the snoring sweating mass of humanity and went looking for dirt malls. \n\nWe made some very, shall we say, “interesting” stops along the way, but one was at what I believe they marketed as an “antique store,“ but in reality was a trailer with a long plastic tent next to it. More like a “semi-indoor yard sale“ I guess. There were a few piles of records, and I'm pretty sure one of them had a brown recluse spider in it, but it was all worth it when I saw this.\n\nI don't know very much about Prince, but this record is a mix of modern soul with a West Indies feel, with a slight Christian leaning. It was released in 1980. Prince plays guitar and there's a whole series of backup instruments including electric piano, synthesizer, etc. While there are many good songs, <em>If you Believe</em> is a stand out, the best song on the album for me is called <em>Once again it's Christmas time</em> which I revisit most holidays. It's melancholy at it's best, and speaks to the struggles in that part of the world. The lyrics say it all: “Once again it's Christmas time, not everyone is doing fine, down in the ghetto people are suffering, down in the ghetto babies are crying, want some food to eat, in need of shoes on their feet.” \n\nHARD FILED. \n\n{{header \"Cellutron and the Invisible\"}}\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/corrections1/image3.jpeg \"(Insert Photo 4)\"}}\nThis one is a doozy. And I'm cheating a little bit. Green Mountain records is a tiny little label in Northfield, Vermont. That is roughly somewhere between 15 and 28 miles from my house, depending on which way you go. The reason I say I'm cheating is that despite my proximity to the label, I've never even seen one of these anywhere out in the world. Not at a record show, not a record store, not in a thrift store, not anywhere else ever. I had to (sigh) buy this on the internet, despite the great shame in having done so. And now this is where I'm supposed to say “but at least I got a deal!“ but that would be a damn lie and I know it. Good news is I paid the “2003 going rate” as opposed to “now that VINYLS are back 2021 going rate.” So there's that I guess… \n\nI've always had a soft spot for records recorded in Vermont, and this is no exception. There are also a bunch of other cool records on this weird little label (which by rumor was eventually shut down under mysterious circumstances, I've never been able to get a straight story from anyone). If you see them they are generally worth the pittance they sell for, excepting the endless fiddler comps. Those can get tedious, at least to my untrained ear. \n\nThis record, however, is the probably the coolest and most mysterious. Made by a man named Bob Greely, using state of the art 70's equipment like the Oberhiem digital sequencer and ARP 2600, as well as a host of other instruments, it's it's own unique universe. There is some rumor that Bob did the whole thing himself, and is potentially evidenced by the fact that most of the musicians are with credit names like “Indiana Straight” and “space boy” etc. Madlib would be proud, although as I write this I'm struck by the fact that he probably actually has a copy. \n\nIt's psychedelic space music, owing both to progressive rock and the history of electronic music. With a name like <em>Reflecting On The First Watch, We Uncover Treasure Buried For The Blind</em> you know you need to buckle in. Think Nic Raicevic and Berlinger school noodling on mild psychedelics and all the weed they can get their hands on. It swirls and crashes and soars in equal intervals. Breathtaking combination of sound and feeling, probably at least partially due to the mix of digital and analog instruments. My favorite section is the B side, which starts with the song <em>Parisian Frequency Shift</em> which bleeds and squelches into <em>Reap the Whirlwind</em> before ending with a flourish that wouldn't be out of place on a keyboard demonstration record. And I say that as a compliment, just to be clear. \n\nThe dedication says that this record was “inspired by the Holy Ghost.“\nAmen to that, brother.\n\n{{header \"Jerry Farber Quartet\"}}\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/corrections1/image4.jpeg \"(Insert Photo 5)\"}}\nA new addition to the collection. On a recent trip to New York to meet up with the cousin Country Joe, I stopped at one of the many little spots along the way. This one jumped out at me, having just hit the new arrival bin and being available for the “nice price,” as they say. \n\nJerry Farber seems to be mostly in the mode of lounge-y jazz, and this record has a lot of covers, many of which are quite good. He does a decent version of <em>Comin' Home Baby</em> and <em>Moon Dance</em> as well as a few others. It's called “music for friends“ on the cover, although based on the music and the setting I imagine it's much more the “Hey! You know my friend Jerry? You remember Jerry right? No, Jerry! Good guy. Good guy. Next round on you? Beautiful!” spoken through smokey 7&7 breath just a little bit too close type friends. But I digress…\n\nBack to the music. The real gems on this record are the songs featuring Stephanie Pettis on flute. Chief amongst those is their sick rendition of <em>Ain't no Sunshine</em> which goes on for four minutes and 52 seconds of pure fire. I think Bill would approve. It's on YouTube, so definitely worth looking up, but it's a soul jazz monster. I'm sure it's been compiled someplace, I'm not sure where as I didn't bother to Google it, but it's nice to have this in the original format. \n\nAnd it also must be noted that bass is played by Luelle Flavor, which is unquestionably the single greatest name for a bass player in the history of recorded music. \n\nThe last song at first seems a touch out of place, it's a version of <em>Have Negilah</em> done jazzy lounge style. But that's why records are the best sometimes, as flipping the cover over can clarify things. In the loving description written on the back by Barry Farber (who is credited only as “WOR-AM TALK SHOW HOST) but I'd guess may be a relation. He lets us know that Jerry's “first public appearance was at his own bar mitzvah where he replaced a very bad piano player in setting with the band for the entire evening.” Being someone who insisted on DJing his own wedding, I immediately felt a kinship with the man. \n\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/corrections1/image5.jpeg \"(Insert Photo 6)\"}}\n\nThe record is signed on the back “To Laura and Bob Silverman. Hope you enjoy the sounds!”\nI'm sure they did Jerry, and so do I.\n\nUntil next time,\nLfV\n`\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"TH04\",\n        \"title\": \"Mike's Choice Links\",\n        \"subtitle\": \"Guest Spot\",\n        \"date\": \"January 2022\",\n        \"coverImage\": {\n            \"full\": \"https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/th04/th04.png\",\n            \"small\": \"https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/th04/th04.png\",\n        },\n        \"content\": \n`\n{{image https://nighterrands.s3.amazonaws.com/thoughts/th04/th04.png \"Vibes\"}}\nRobert Elliot Kahn.

The internet loves scale.\n\nChoice links, to me, is the art of finding that obscure beauty in this dumpster dive we call surfin' the web.
